	- Added &ldquo;Gamma-prime&rdquo; correction to phonon force matrix that guarantees finite sound velocities regardless of numerical error
	- Always outputs finite free energies neglecting imaginary components
	- Detailed warning about imaginary frequencies including maximum magnitude and corresponding wave vector

	- Handling of Fcut for insulators with smearing
	- Free energy report for 1x1x1 supercell (all components previously zero)
	- Error in diagonal e-ph matrix elements (caused a minor indirect error; only through interpolation)
	- Added work-around for bug in CUDA-aware OpenMPI (segfault when bcast'ing from GPU pointers)

## 1.3.0 - 2017-07-29
[Site archive](http://jdftx.org/1.3.0)

+ Space group symmetrization instead of point groups alone.
  This now allows for calculations to be equally efficient
  regardless of where the structure is centered.
  This also substantially reduces the number of supercell
  calculations required by phonon for many systems.
  IMPORTANT: this may reduce number of k points for certain systems
  which will make the state incompatible from previous versions.

+ Adjusted automatic FFT grid selection to be supercell-consistent
  i.e. minimum grid dimensions of unit cell, when multiplied by supercell count,
  will satisfy minimum grid dimensions for corresponding supercell at same plane-wave cutoff.
  IMPORTANT: default FFT boxes will change in some cases relative to 1.2.1 and earlier.
  This will only alter real-space grid outputs; wavefunctions remain unchanged.

+ Switched to reciprocal-space symmetrization of scalar fields

+ Changed supercell cell map determination to use %Wannier centers / atom positions
  which makes %Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonians and phonon force matrices strictly
  supercell-consistent and translation-invariant  (which they previously weren't).
  Importantly, this allows Gamma-only %Wannier and phonon calculations for large systems.

+ Fixed numerous bugs in phonon code for cases with more than one atom per unit cell,
  eg. when symmetries of phonon supercell mapped atoms to ones in other unit cells,
  complex conjugate handling of non-inversion-symmetric cells etc.

+ Support to split phonon calculations into individual perturbations that
  can be run separately (and in parallel) and collected together at the end.
  Added a summary output to phonon dry runs that facilitates planning the split calculations.

+ Added phonon tutorials

+ Added support for electric fields in periodic directions using low wave-vector perturbations.
  This enables bulk dielectric calculations using new command bulk-epsilon.

+ Added support for anisotropic dielectric functions and surface defects
  without slab-mode %Coulomb truncation in charged-defect-correction

+ Added command exchange-parameters for controlling EXX scale factor and screening in hybrid functionals

+ Added MPI and noncollinear support to exact exchange

+ Added command symmetry-threshold to control symmetry detection sensitivity in input file

+ Fixed phase of odd-l trial orbitals in %Wannier (these were previously pure-imaginary instead of real)

+ Fixed strange bugs in phonon and %Wannier codes that resulted from unused pseudopotentials specified in input file

+ Redefined subspace rotation factor to be consistent with the grand-canonical DFT paper,
  so that reasonable initial values are close to 1 (rather than 100 previously).

+ Restored non-variational energy and gradient calculation for LinearPCM and SaLSA
  because it substantially improves the quality of the electrostatic potential,
  especially in large unit cells and low concentrations.
  Correspondingly, removed the option to run them with a Gummel iteration (introduced in 1.1.0).
  A related change substantially improves potentials output
  by NonlinearPCM when using pcm-nonlinear-scf.

+ Updated LibXC support version to >=3, and added mechanism to auto-generate
  list of LibXC functionals by parsing its header file.

+ Added a 1D (planarly-averaged for slabs) dielectric matrix output to electron-scattering

+ Added support for BlueGene/Q systems

+ Added a CMake option for automating static linking


## 1.2.1 - 2016-07-30
[Site archive](http://jdftx.org/1.2.1)

+ Added Gaussian and Cold smearing options in addition to the original Fermi fillings,
  and deprecated the old elec-fermi-fillings command in favor of elec-smearing.

+ Added outer loop over fixed charge calculations (using secant method to optimize
  nElectrons) as an alternate fall-back method for fixed-potential calculations.

+ Stabilized initialization of fixed-potential calculations using
  LCAO followed by an automatic initial vacuum calculation

+ Switched to density mixing as the default for SCF.

+ Improved stability of new Y-less minimizer against large steps by remembering
  subspace rotations for the duration of one line minimize.

+ Fixed a bug in ionic minimize search-direction symmetrization introduced in 1.2.0

+ Added a mechanism to gracefully deprecate commands: a placeholder for the old
  command issues a deprecation warning and replaces itself with the new syntax,
  so that the output file shows the new syntax and all other command code
  (dependencies / forbids etc.) only need to deal with the new command.


## 1.2.0 - 2016-07-10
[Site archive](http://jdftx.org/1.2.0)

+ Substantial memory optimizations, reducing typical usage by 30-50 % overall:

  - Total energy minimize: switched from analytically-continued (Y and C) to orthonormal-only
    (C alone) algorithm, which eliminates one persistent copy of the wavefunctions
  
  - SCF: reduced memory usage of the BandDavidson algorithm by eliminating cached copies of the
    overlap operator applied to the wavefunctions, and also of the conjugate-gradients
    BandMinimizer by switching away from the analytically -continued approach.
    
  - Reduced peak memory usage further by improving move semantics and delaying / combining
    key ColumnBundle and matrix operations using template meta-programming.
    
  - Added debug code options in ManagedMemory to stack-trace peak memory usage points

+ Rewrote auxiliary Hamiltonian fillings algorithm with automatic preconditioner tuning,
  resulting in substantially better convergence, including at fixed potential.
  Auxiliary Hamiltonian is kept diagonal in new algorithm; the state for the
  new variable-fillings optimizer therefore uses eigenvals instead of Haux (deleted).

+ Improved stability of ionic and lattice minimizers against occasional unphysically large steps.

+ Updated WannierMinimizer to continuously update rotations in-place,
  analogous to the changes in  ElecMinimizer and BandMinimizer, and switched
  to L-BFGS as the default optimizer (faster than CG after these changes).

+ Removed: defunct fillings algorithms such as periodic mixing and mu controller, inverse Kohn-Sham minimizer and fix-occupied functionality

+ Individual-frame output and %Wannier orbital support in the createXSF script

+ Expanded test set that covers salient features (loosely based on the new tutorial sequence)

+ Complete set of tutorials for molecules, solids, surfaces and %Wannier function calculations

+ Detailed compilation instructions for Debian and Redhat-based GNU/Linux, MacOS X and Cygwin/Windows


## 1.1.2 - 2016-06-10
[Site archive](http://jdftx.org/1.1.2)

+ Added support for compiling and running on Windows using Cygwin

+ Added option to link JDFTx statically

+ New detailed tutorial set for molecular systems

+ Energy correction for charged defects at surfaces in vacuum and solution

+ Consistent behavior for binary file I/O on big-endian architectures such as PowerPC64 (eg. BlueGene)


## 1.1.1 - 2016-05-04
[Site archive](http://jdftx.org/1.1.1)

+ Moved auxiliary executables to aux making their compilation optional, and renamed testsuite to test

+ Fixed compilation for new compilers: up to g++-5.3, Clang 3.8 and CUDA 7.5 


## 1.1.0 - 2016-04-14
[Site archive](http://jdftx.org/1.1.0)

+ Improved convergence and fixed initialization errors in the SCF version of NonlinearPCM,
  and included softening of ion packing limit to eliminate NANs

+ Timing information in all iterations (electrons, fluids, geometry etc.),
  and corresponding support in the plotConvergence script

+ Added command to control whether to use Gummel loop or inner minimization for any fluid type.
  Correspondingly, energy evaluation in LinearPCM and SaLSA is now strictly variational
  (rather than generically first-order correct) to support Gummel iteration.
  
+ Added command to control electrostatic potential output (raw or atom-potential corrected)

+ Automatic initial vacuum electronic solve in fixed-mu fluid calculations remain neutral for consistency

+ Renamed ion dynamics classes (not named specifically Verlet any more), and added confining potential options

+ Added HyperPlane constraint to constrain combined motion of several ions
  and fixed transformation of linear constraint from lattice coordinates
