/** \page CompilingBasic Basic compilation

Download the latest JDFTx source package from [GitHub](https://github.com/shankar1729/jdftx/tags)
into the directory where you want to install it (eg. /home/user/JDFTx), which we'll refer to as JDFTXDIR below.
In a terminal, the following commands should unpack, configure and build jdftx:

    cd JDFTXDIR                     #Replace JDFTXDIR with the path you chose
    ls                              #This should show jdftx-VERSION.tar.gz
    tar xvpzf jdftx-VERSION.tar.gz  #Unpack; replace X,Y,Z with the actual version numbers
                                    #(Or for jdftx-VERSION.zip, use the unzip command)
    
    mkdir build                             #Create a directory for the build
    cd build                                #and enter the build directory
    cmake [options] ../jdftx-VERSION/jdftx  #Configure; omit [options] or see Customization below
    make -j4                                #Compile with 4 processes (adjust as needed)

Note that these commands will unpack the source to JDFTXDIR/jdftx-VERSION/jdftx,
and once successful will produce executables jdftx, phonon and wannier
in the JDFTXDIR/build directory.
Note that for a basic compilation with all the dependencies mentioned above
installed in system locations, you don't need to specify any [options] to cmake.

That should be it!  You can run "make test" to check that the code
is producing expected numbers for a few built-in test cases.
In order to use the executable from any directory in your system,
and to also use post-processing scripts distributed with JDFTx,
you will need to add the build and scripts directory to your PATH:

    export PATH="JDFTXDIR/build:JDFTXDIR/jdftx-VERSION/jdftx/scripts:$PATH"

(Remember to replace JDFTXDIR with the actual path, eg. /home/user/JDFTx,
and VERSION with the actual version string throughout.)
This setting will last only for the current session if you enter it in the terminal.
To make it persistent, add the above line to <b>.bashrc</b> in your home directory.
On Mac systems, add the above line to <b>.bash_profile</b> in your home directory instead.
If you need to update the code, download a newer tarball and follow the same instructions.

Alternatively, if you need a recent update or plan to modify the code,
you can get and compile the latest development version using:

    cd JDFTXDIR
    git clone https://github.com/shankar1729/jdftx.git jdftx-git
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake [options] ../jdftx-git/jdftx
    make -j4

Note that the only difference is that git will fetch jdftx source files within
a subdirectory called jdftx-git, so that VERSION is now "git" instead.

To update the code, you can subsequently use **git pull** from within the jdftx-git directory
to fetch latest changes from the repository, and then run cmake and make in the build directory.
See the [git documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation) for more details.
